<p>
  Hello! My name is Julia Ream (she/her). I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.math.fsu.edu">Department of Mathematics</a> at Florida State University.
</p>

<p>
  My research focuses on developing and using hybrid numerical methods to better understand complex fluids and multiphysics systems.
</p>

<p>
  Applications of interest within this area include studying the turbulence mechanics of supercritical carbon dioxide and designing numerical methods for redox flow battery simulations.
